👋 Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! You can call me SanoSenpai, a passionate software engineer with a love for crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. My journey in the world of programming began with a simple curiosity and has since evolved into a full-blown passion.

Here's a glimpse into my toolkit:

🛠 Tech Stack:

Workbench · MySQL · Git · Sourcetree: Delving into database management, version control, and collaborative coding.
IntelliJ IDEA · VS Code: Embracing the power of IDEs for a smoother development journey.
Postman API · Chrome DevTools: Exploring the realms of API testing and debugging for optimal performance.

⚙️ Development Skills:

React · Angular: Building dynamic and responsive user interfaces for modern web applications is my current adventure.
Java: Navigating the world of Java development, with a focus on ensuring code efficiency and reliability.

🔧 On GitHub, you'll find a mix of personal projects, and perhaps some fun experiments I've been tinkering with, also things I did when I was a student.

🌟 Thank you for stopping by!
